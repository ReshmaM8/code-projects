The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece.

You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life. The realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears.
